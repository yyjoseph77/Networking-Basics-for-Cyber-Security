Network Basics for Security

This repository contains fundamental concepts of computer networking with a focus on cybersecurity applications. It is intended for beginners who want to understand how networks work and how network traffic can be analyzed for security purposes.

The content covers basic networking concepts such as IP address, MAC address, DNS, TCP/UDP, along with practical hands-on tasks using Wireshark. It includes packet capturing, protocol filtering (HTTP, DNS, TCP), observing the TCP three-way handshake, identifying plain-text and encrypted traffic, analyzing DNS queries, and saving packet captures for further analysis.

This repository is useful for students, beginners in cybersecurity, and network security learners who want to build a strong foundation in network traffic analysis.
